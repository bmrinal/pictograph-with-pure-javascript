pictograph-with-pure-javascript
===============================

An open source sample pictograph application using HTML 5 drag and drop.
The complete code is written using pure javascript and HTML5 APIs(canvas, draganddrop etc.)

A very good exercise for someone jumping into rendering based on pure js using HTML5 Canvas features.

<h3>Features</h3>
No setup required. Just open the index.html and it should run out of the box!<br>
Pure javascript<br>
HTML5 canvas plus drag and drop API<br>
Multiple pictographs can be added<br>
The data in pictograph can be dynamically supplied through a GUI<br>
You can even publish the generated pictograph as an image!
