pictograph-with-pure-javascript
===============================

An open source sample pictograph application using HTML 5 drag and drop.
The complete code is written using pure javascript and HTML5 APIs(canvas, draganddrop etc.)

A very good exercise for someone jumping into rendering based on pure js using HTML5 Canvas features.

Features

Pure javascript
HTML5 canvas plus drag and drop API
Multiple pictographs can be added
The data in pictograph can be dynamically supplied through a GUI
